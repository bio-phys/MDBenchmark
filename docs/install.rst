Installation
============

Why isolated environments matter
--------------------------------

Installing a new python package into the main python environment of your system
can lead to unforeseen consequences. Python packages can have dependencies on
different versions of the same package, i.e. ``numpy``. If package ``packageA``
depends on ``numpy==1.14.1`` and you install ``packageB``, which depends on
``numpy==1.9.2``, then ``packageA`` may stop to work. Isolating packages into
their own environments makes sure to provide the needed dependencies, while not
disrupting the dependencies of other packages (in other environments).

Depending on your setup, there are different ways to create an isolated
environment. In the normal Python world, one calls them `virtual environment`_,
while users of the Anaconda distribution know them as `conda environment`_.

We recommend to install the package inside a `conda environment`_, while the
other ways are also supported.

Install via ``conda``
---------------------

Installation for Anaconda users is handled by ``conda``. The following commands
create an environment called ``benchmark`` and install ``mdbenchmark`` inside.

.. code::

    conda create -n benchmark
    conda install -n benchmark -c conda-forge mdbenchmark

Before every usage of ``mdbenchmark``, you need to first activate the conda
environment via ``source activate benchmark``. After doing this once, you can
use ``mdbenchmark`` for the duration of your shell session.

.. code::

   source activate benchmark

Install via ``pip``
-------------------

Installation with ``pip`` should also be done inside a virtual environment.

.. code::

   python3 -m venv benchmark-env

This created a new directory called ``benchmark-env``, if it did not exist
before. Now you can activate the environment, as described above.

.. code::

   source benchmark-env/bin/activate

After activating the environment, you should be able to install the package via
``pip``.

.. note::

  The ``--user`` option leads to the installation of the package in your home
  directory ``$HOME``. If you are not using the option, you may get errors due
  to missing write permissions.

.. code::

   pip install --user mdbenchmark

The method requires you to remember where you put the virtual environment and
always specify the path when activating. ``conda`` makes this easier. Several
python packages try to make up for this and provide some wrappers, like
`virtualenvwrapper`_.


Install via ``pipenv``
----------------------

The easiest way is to install the package is via ``pipenv``. First install
``pipenv`` (refer to its `documentation`_).

.. code::

   pip install --user pipenv

Now you can let ``pipenv`` take care of creating the virtual environment. The
only downside here is, that you will always need to call ``mdbenchmark`` from
the folder you installed it in.

.. code::

   pipenv install mdbenchmark
   pipenv run mdbenchmark

You can also activate the virtual environment once and then visit different
directories afterwards::

  pipenv shell
  cd ..
  mdbenchmark
